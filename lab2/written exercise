1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
    The main advantage to using setImmediate() over setTimeout() is setImmediate() 
    will always be executed before any timers if scheduled within an I/O cycle, 
    independently of how many timers are present.
    setTimeout is slower because it will check the timer at least once before executing.


2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?

    process.nextTick queues its callbacks on the nextTick queue while setImmediate 
    queues its callbacks on the event loop. Another difference is process.nextTick
    callbacks get executed before setImmediate callbacks.
